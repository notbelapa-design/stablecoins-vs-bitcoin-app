        <h2>What Are Stablecoins?</h2>
        <p>
          Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain a stable value by
          pegging to external assets such as fiat currencies, commodities or
          other cryptocurrencies. The most common variety are <em>fiat‑backed</em>
          stablecoins, which hold reserves of currencies like the U.S. dollar
          or euro to secure their value. These reserves are managed by
          independent custodians and are meant to ensure that each token can
          always be redeemed for the underlying asset on a one‑for‑one basis【442640687114059†L675-L681】【889365136519448†L379-L386】.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other types include <em>crypto‑collateralized</em> stablecoins, which use
          baskets of cryptocurrencies as collateral and are often over‑
          collateralized to account for volatility【442640687114059†L683-L689】, and
          <em>algorithmic</em> stablecoins that rely on supply‑adjustment
          algorithms rather than explicit collateral—a design that has proved
          fragile during market stress【442640687114059†L694-L706】.

        <h2>Stablecoins and Fiat: Digital Dollars</h2>
        <p>
          Fiat‑backed stablecoins function much like balances in a payment app
          or digital wallet. A single company issues tokens on a blockchain and
          holds the corresponding reserves off‑chain. Because the issuer has
          control over the underlying bank accounts and the smart contracts
          governing the tokens, these stablecoins are essentially tokenized
          dollars controlled by a centralized entity【442640687114059†L675-L681】. 
          They can be frozen or confiscated by the issuer, and users must
          trust that reserves are managed properly and audited regularly【580956979939548†L1151-L1156】.
        </p>
        <p>
          This centralized design makes stablecoins useful for trading and
          settlements, but it also means they inherit many of the same risks as
          traditional payment systems: counter‑party risk, regulatory exposure
          and dependence on banking partners. De‑pegging events—such as the
          temporary loss of peg by Tether and the collapse of TerraUSD—show
          that stablecoins are not immune to runs and market stress【580956979939548†L1192-L1203】.

      <!-- Comparison with cryptocurrencies -->
      <section class="section" id="comparison">
        <h2>How Stablecoins Differ From Other Crypto</h2>
        <p>
          Most cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ether, are designed to be
          scarce digital assets whose prices float freely on the market. Their
          value can be highly volatile, making them unsuitable for everyday
          transactions. Stablecoins aim to solve this problem by offering a
          low‑volatility token that can be used as a medium of exchange and
          unit of account in decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross‑border
          payments【277050960067016†L187-L214】. However, this stability comes at
          the cost of centralization or the complexity of collateral and
          algorithms. In contrast, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are
          decentralized and do not depend on any issuer or collateral for
          their value.

      <!-- Why Bitcoin is better -->
      <section class="section highlight" id="bitcoin-better">
        <h2>Why Bitcoin Is Different</h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin was created as a peer‑to‑peer electronic cash system that
          allows individuals to send and receive value without needing a
          central authority【874130077474567†L400-L406】. The Bitcoin network is
          maintained collectively by its users; no single person or group has
          control over the blockchain, and transactions are irreversible and
          transparent【550298790957234†L355-L358】. This decentralization makes
          Bitcoin resistant to censorship and seizure—if you control your
          private keys, no institution can freeze your funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike fiat currencies or stablecoins, Bitcoin has a predetermined
          issuance schedule and a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins【874130077474567†L415-L417】【569625722084678†L21-L53】. This algorithmic scarcity
          gives Bitcoin properties similar to a scarce commodity and prevents
          inflation or arbitrary supply expansion by governments or
          corporations. Because nobody owns or controls the protocol, Bitcoin
          operates as open‑source money that is free from government or
          corporate control【646368507248952†L139-L141】.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Bitcoin’s price can be volatile in the short term, many see it
          as a long‑term store of value (“digital gold”) and a hedge against
          inflation. Its decentralized, censorship‑resistant design makes it
          fundamentally different from stablecoins, which are digital
          representations of existing currencies with all the attendant
          counter‑party risk.

      <section class="section" id="net-art">
        <h2>Bitcoin Net Art &amp; Vision</h2>
        <!-- Introductory explanation -->
        <p>
          Beyond its technical design, Bitcoin has inspired a flourishing
          community of digital artists. Many of these artists create <em>net art</em>—
          works that live online and use imagery, animation and interactivity
          to represent the protocol’s unique qualities. Below are a few
          simple yet powerful concepts that illustrate the core ideas behind
          Bitcoin and why people believe it could become the internet’s own
          native money.
        </p>

        <!-- Decentralized network concept -->
        <h3>1. Decentralized Web of Nodes</h3>
        <p>
          One popular motif shows a glowing network of interconnected nodes,
          hinting at how thousands of computers around the world maintain
          Bitcoin without a central server or controlling company. The art
          often uses soft gradients and flowing lines to convey how value
          can move freely across this open network, underscoring
          censorship‑resistance and independence from traditional banking.
        </p>

        <!-- Halving and scarcity concept -->
        <h3>2. Scarcity &amp; Halving Cycles</h3>
        <p>
          Other net art pieces take inspiration from Bitcoin’s pre‑programmed
          issuance schedule. Generative patterns, slowly fading waves or
          spiralling shapes reflect the halving cycles that cut issuance
          every four years. These works emphasize that only 21 million
          coins will ever exist and that no government or corporation can
          inflate the supply【874130077474567†L415-L417】【569625722084678†L21-L53】.
        </p>

        <!-- Transparency and open ledger concept -->
        <h3>3. Transparent Ledgers</h3>
        <p>
          Some artists play with layers of translucent blocks or grids to
          evoke a public ledger. Light shines through overlapping panes to
          represent how everyone can verify transactions and audit the
          system. This transparency contrasts with the opaque nature of
          stablecoin reserves and traditional finance, reminding viewers
          that Bitcoin operates out in the open【550298790957234†L355-L358】.
        </p>

        <!-- Borderless remittance and everyday payments concept -->
        <h3>4. Borderless Flow of Money</h3>
        <p>
          Lastly, visualizations of arcs spanning continents or animated
          particles zipping across a map highlight Bitcoin’s potential as a
          neutral payment rail. By removing intermediaries and gatekeepers,
          the network can deliver low‑cost remittances and everyday payments
          almost instantly—an idea championed by entrepreneurs who see
          Bitcoin as the native currency of the internet. This concept
          reinforces the main point: decentralization and scarcity enable
          global money that belongs to everyone.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <section class="section conclusion" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Stablecoins have become indispensable tools for crypto trading and
          modern payments. By tokenizing fiat currencies, they offer a familiar
          unit of account with the programmability of blockchain. However, this
          convenience comes with reliance on centralized issuers and
          corresponding regulatory and counter‑party risks. Bitcoin, by
          contrast, is an independent, decentralized network with scarce supply
          and no controlling entity. It is designed to be censorship‑resistant
          and inflation‑proof. Understanding these differences helps you
          appreciate why stablecoins can be practical in the short term while
          Bitcoin offers a truly sovereign alternative for the long term. Many
          advocates see its open architecture as a blueprint for a native
          currency of the internet—supporting fast, low‑cost remittances and
          everyday payments without dependence on banks or governments.
