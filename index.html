      <h2>What Are Stablecoins?</h2>
      <p>Stablecoins are digital tokens that aim to keep a stable value by being backed by reserves. Most are issued by companies that hold dollars or other assets in bank accounts so each token is supposed to be redeemable for a dollar. In practice, they work like balances in payment apps – you trust the issuer to hold the reserves and you rely on the company to manage those funds.</p>

      <h2>Why Stablecoins Are Digital Dollars</h2>
      <p>Because a single company controls the bank accounts and the smart contracts that mint and burn the tokens, stablecoins are effectively tokenized dollars. The issuer can freeze or confiscate tokens and you depend on their audits and regulators for assurance. In other words, they carry the same counter‑party and regulatory risks as any digital wallet.</p>

      <h2>What Makes Bitcoin Different?</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin isn’t issued by any company or government. It’s an open network where anyone can participate and no one can control or censor transactions. The supply is limited to 21 million coins by code, so no central bank can inflate it. While its price fluctuates, this decentralized design and algorithmic scarcity make Bitcoin more like digital gold than a digital dollar.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Stablecoins are useful for trading and moving money quickly, but they’re still dependent on centralized custodians. Bitcoin offers a decentralized alternative with a fixed supply and censorship‑resistant transactions, giving you full control over your money.</p>
